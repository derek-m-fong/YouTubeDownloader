# YouTubeDownloader
A CLI for downloading YouTube Videos with various options.

# Install before running:
# pytube (ex: pip install pytube)
# progress (ex: pip install progress)
# To run, type python YouTube_Downloader.py (you can try python3 too)
# If python is installed incorrectly, this program may run into issues.
# For testing, input "test" as the first input for a short 1 second video instead of a URL
# For manual testing, use the following 1 second youtube video =
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhFDyDgMVUI  
# I recommend any short youtube video for testing to limit bandwidth

# If you get an error during testing, this may be because the file is already present in the location that you are using. i.e, if you run "test" 2 times it may give an error as the file is already present in the default location of the desktop. This can happen on occassion.
